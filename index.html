          <h2>Why vinyl pool liners are perfect for island pools</h2>
          <p>
            A properly installed vinyl liner gives you a <strong>smooth, comfortable surface</strong>, clean visual lines,
            and easier maintenance compared to rough, pitted plaster. When sized and set correctly, it resists wrinkles,
            reduces algae hangouts, and helps your pool stay brighter, longer.
          </p>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Comfortable underfoot</strong> – gentle on keiki feet and hands.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleaner surface</strong> – less porous than plaster, easier to brush.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual refresh</strong> – color and pattern options that transform the whole backyard.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-effective</strong> – replaces worn surfaces without total reconstruction.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We handle the entire process: measuring, ordering, draining, surface prep, liner install, refill,
            and chemistry balance—so you can just enjoy the water.

            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <h3>On-site inspection</h3>
            <p>
              We inspect your existing liner, structure, and equipment, measure your pool, and talk through goals, budget, and timing.

            <h3>Custom liner order</h3>
            <p>
              Your measurements are sent to the manufacturer for a liner built to your pool’s exact shape and depth profile.

            <h3>Prep & install</h3>
            <p>
              We drain, remove the old liner, inspect the floor and walls, make repairs as needed, then carefully hang and vacuum-set the new liner.

              We refill, start up the equipment, balance chemicals, and walk you through care so your new liner stays beautiful as long as possible.
